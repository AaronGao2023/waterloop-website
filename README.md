# Waterloop Website

## Why do we need a website?

Our website represents the Waterloop team professionally, to help establish and sustain our network of supporters and sponsors, as well as showcase all the cool stuff the team is working on. It also acts as the portal through which candidates apply to our various subteams every recruitment cycle.

## ðŸ’» Technologies

The website codebase is written in ReactTS (TypeScript), and connects to the CMS server repo which is written in ExpressJS.

## Setup

0. Ensure you have `node v16`, `yarn v1` installed. See onboarding docs for more info.
1. Ensure you've already setup `waterloop-cms`. Please follow the README.md guide for waterloop-cms if you haven't already.
1. Install dependencies with `yarn install`
2. Create a `.env` file, then copy + paste relevant variables from [wloop.ca/web-env-vars](wloop.ca/web-env-vars)
3. Launch the website in a new terminal with `yarn start`
