            description="Goose V expands upon the LIM design from Goose IV by incorporating it alongside a conservative, scalable and cost-effective subsystem design approach. We also use a DLIM which involves 2 LIMs on either side of the I-beam track to allow for a stronger magnetic field to be maintained. The frame is made of square aluminum tubing and welded in a truss structure, weighing 10 kg in total. Our brakes, manufactured by W.C. Branham, use coiled springs to apply friction to the rail, causing the pod to come to a stop. The battery management system is used to monitor and balance the cell array used to power the LIM and low voltage systems. Our user interface was developed using QT Designer, QML, and C++; it displays sensor data about the podâ€™s performance, and provides a platform to control the pod remotely."

            desc="Like a Rotary Induction Motor but cut up on its centre axis and with the stator and rotor unrolled flat, a linear induction motor produces thrust through a linear force rather than through torque. This allows it to function on an unpowered conductive track, thereby saving costs in maintenance and per-unit track costs. Despite the disadvantage of end effects (or 'turbulence') leading to lower speeds, the LIM offers contactless propulsion on a simpler track such as an aluminum one. Furthermore, the LIM allows for a centralized design that reduces the weight of the entire pod, and there are a variety of opportunities to scale up the LIM design and promises of better levitation technologies to use with the LIM. We use the DLIM (or Double-sided LIM) design, which involves 2 LIMs on either side of the I-beam track, to allow for a stronger magnetic field to be maintained.">

            desc="The brakes are designed to slow the pod to a stop, whether the pod has reached its top speed, experienced a failure or to hold the pod stationary on the rail when powered off. For Competition V, we used industry-leading Hyperloop-spec brakes produced by W.C. Branham in the USA. The brakes use coiled springs to apply the friction pads to the rail, and they are bolted to the frame with a support plate to ensure a robust mechanical system. The brakes are placed at the front and rear of the pod to maximize stopping force.">
