      "heading1": "SpaceX Hyperloop Competition",
      "text1": "The Hyperloop Competition is an annual event hosted by SpaceX at their headquarters to showcase the best student Hyperloop pods from around the world and promote development and adoption of Hyperloop technology. We’ve placed in the top 50 worldwide every year since the competition’s inception, were the first to demonstrate pneumatic levitation, and have been invited twice to the on-site finals.",
      "heading2": "Cutting Edge Engineering",
      "text2": "Contactless propulsion is critical for durability and reliability at the high speed of a full-scale Hyperloop, so for two years we’ve been developing a custom linear induction motor. With ANSYS electromagnetic sims, manufacturing from steel core and copper coils, design of a custom multi-kW controller board, and carefully optimizing real-time control systems, we’re constantly inventing solutions to incredibly difficult problems.",
      "heading3": "Building Our Track",
      "text3": "We’re looking beyond just the Hyperloop Competition, and aiming far higher. To promote the innovation necessary for a Hyperloop-enabled future, we’re constructing Canada’s first Hyperloop track right here in Waterloo with the intent to host a competition to promote further innovation, create real-world testing opportunities for transportation researchers, and scale up to a full-scale demonstration by 2025."
