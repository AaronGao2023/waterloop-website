      "heading1": "SpaceX Hyperloop Competition",
      "text1": "The Hyperloop Competition is an annual event hosted by SpaceX at their Hawthorne, CA headquarters to showcase the best student hyperloop pods from around the world and promote the development and adoption of Hyperloop technology. We’ve been involved since the very beginning; we were the first to demonstrate pneumatic levitation, have placed in the top 50 worldwide every year, and have been invited to the on-site final round of competition twice.",
      "heading2": "Cutting Edge Engineering",
      "text2": "There are only a handful of ways to propel a Hyperloop pod, and in line with our vision of building a full-scale Hyperloop, we need a contactless propulsion method in order to have practical durability and reliability at extremely high speeds. The cornerstone of our pod design this year is its linear induction motor—encompassing detailed simulations of electromagnetic effects, efficient manufacturing from steel alloy core and copper coils, design of a fully custom multi-kW motor control board, and writing of carefully optimized real-time control systems, we’re constantly researching, engineering, and testing solutions to incredibly difficult problems.",
      "heading3": "Building Our Track",
      "text3": "We’re looking beyond just the Hyperloop Competition, and aiming far higher. To promote the innovation necessary for a Hyperloop-enabled future, we’re constructing Canada’s first Hyperloop track right here in Waterloo with the intent to host a competition to promote further innovation, create real-world testing opportunities for transportation researchers, and scale up to a full-scale demonstration by 2025."
